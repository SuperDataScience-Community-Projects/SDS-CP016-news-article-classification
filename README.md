# Welcome to the SuperDataScience Community Project!
Welcome to the News Article Classification repository! ðŸŽ‰

This project is a collaborative initiative brought to you by SuperDataScience, a thriving community dedicated to advancing the fields of data science, machine learning, and AI. We are excited to have you join us in this journey of learning, experimentation, and growth.

## About This Project
In this repository, youâ€™ll find the work carried out by our community members in completing an end-to-end machine learning project. Please note that the resources available here is not to be used or copied without referencing the appropriate authors.

## Project Objectives
- Build a model which accurately classifies news articles to an appropriate topic
- Build a web app interface which allows users to use the model

## Project Phases & Timeline

**Data Cleaning & Analysis (Week 1)**
- Handling null values, fixing data types, data inconsistencies
- EDA

**Feature Engineering & Model Selection (Week 2)**  
- Building new features, merging other forms of data
- Training traditional NLP models
- Performance evaluation of traditional NLP models
- Tuning a huggingface model (optional)
- Use generative model to suggest labels to unlabeled articles (optional)
- Evaluate suggested labels and use curated articles to improve traditional NLP models (optional)

**Deployment (Week 3)**
- Building a streamlit app
- Deploying model to app
- Deploying app to streamlit cloud
